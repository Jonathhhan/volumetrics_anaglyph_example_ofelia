# volumetrics_anaglyph_example_ofelia

Added ofxCameraAnaglyph to Ofelia.

https://github.com/NickHardeman/ofxCameraAnaglyph

I changed some small things in ofxCameraAnaglyph - I use ofEasyCam instead of ofCamera, for example.

Installation as described here: https://github.com/Jonathhhan/volumetrics_example_ofelia/blob/main/README.md

Press space to toggle between 3d and 2d view.

Edit: I added ofxOfeliaPdBindings.cpp, so no need to run the shell script, which is easy with linux but no fun with windows...
